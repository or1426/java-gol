This works well for what it is. The number of cells is limited by screen resolution (each cell is 5 pixels by 5 pixels) which is not great.

The format for the saved patterns is:

number of cells in x direction
number of cells in y direction
number of living cells to start with
x position of first living cell
y position of first living cell
.
.
.
.
.
x position of last living cell
y position of last living cell

So to save a "blinker" in a 5 by 5 grid we might have a file that looks like this:

5
5
3
2
1
2
2
2
3


Bear in mind that with a grid this small the buttons and slider will be so small they are basically unuseable if you can't remember which button is which!
