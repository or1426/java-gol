To run the program just put the file Conway.java in a directory, type javac Conway.java to compile it and java Conway (with no extension) to run it. 
Bear in mind that javac will make a load of .class files so put it in a directory you don't mind getting cluttered!

Put the saved patterns wherever you like and just use the open window inside the program to navigate to them. It is probably a good idea to keep them all
in the same place so you don't forget where they are!

It works well for what it is. The number of cells is limited by screen resolution (each cell is 5 pixels by 5 pixels) which is not great.

The format for the saved patterns is:

number of cells in x direction
number of cells in y direction
number of living cells to start with
x position of first living cell
y position of first living cell
x position of second living cell
y position of second living cell
.
.
.
.
.
.
x position of last living cell
y position of last living cell

So to save a "blinker" in a 5 by 5 grid we might have a file that looks like this:

5
5
3
2
1
2
2
2
3

If we ASCII art this up and say O is dead and X is living we will get a screen that looks like this:

OOOOO
OOXOO
OOXOO
OOXOO
OOOOO

Bear in mind that with a grid this small the buttons and slider will be so small they are basically unuseable if you can't remember which button is which!

(Having a given size for the window and changing the size of the cells to match it might be a good idea!)
